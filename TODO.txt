build a simple python script to iterate through pictures and check to see if good or not. 
1) draw rectangle around tagged face
2) use openCV to draw a rectangle around detected faces
3) using a key/user input, either delete the file and associated face coordinates, or move on to the next one!

want to build a haarcascade file using our pictures

would be nice to use https://github.com/biometrics/openbr to build it for us (likely be in c++)
